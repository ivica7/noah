A simple game created by using o3-mini-high prompting. No coding involved.

# Prompts used

"I want to create a game with the biblical theme of the Flood and Noah. Create an executable prototype that we will then refine together step by step. Create it with HTML/JavaScript."

"The game ends immediately when I start it. Something is wrong. Please fix it."

"Okay, better, but it still doesn’t work because the water reaches the ark far too quickly. The ark has no opportunity to collect an animal beforehand at all. Please make it so that I can move the ark in all directions."

"Great... that's much better already! Now please also make it so that the game ends when any one of the animals touches the water."

"Great! Now please make it so that every time I collect 10 animals, I can generate a short boost for the ark with the Space key, which makes the ark faster for 0.5 seconds."

"Please make it so that the ark stands on a scaffold, which is roughly as high as the lower third of the area. The ark is fixed and does not move. Introduce another character that represents Noah. That is, Noah collects the animals and every time he touches an animal, that animal goes by itself to the ark. If an animal randomly touches the ark, that also counts as collected. Keep all other features as they are, i.e., the water rises as before and there is also a boost for Noah, just as there was for the ark."

"The water cannot be seen; could it be that the scaffold is covering it? Make the water appear in front of the scaffold."

"Great! The game also ends when Noah touches the water."

"Can you also make the graphics a little prettier so that it doesn’t just look like geometric shapes?"
